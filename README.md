# We-Grind-Java-Everyday

This is my personal Java playground. Here, I upload the codes I write as I learn, practice, and solve problems. Nothing fancy, just me getting better at Java one grind at a time.

## What's in Here?

- **Basic Problem Solving**: From loops to methods, exception handling, and wrestling with type conversions
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Exploring classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces
- **Data Structures (coming soon-ish)**: Diving into ArrayLists, LinkedLists, HashMaps, and other Java collections

## Why?

Because practice makes perfect (and because my local IDE needs constant attention).

### Learning Path

1. Core Java Fundamentals
2. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
3. Advanced Java Features
4. Data Structures and Algorithms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 11 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA 
- Caffeine (optional but recommended)
